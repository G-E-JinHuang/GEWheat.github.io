## Growing and Eating

### Khorasan Wheat

### Bio
I am Jin, a plant science student studying at University of California, Davis, raised in China-the world largest wheat producer. Grown up eating noodles, steamed buns, and dumplings, I am trapped by the unlimited possibilities of wheat and indulge more as I learnt about its superior nutrition value among all grains. Recently, I fall in love with an ancient wheat species which has sweet corn aroma, nutty flavor, and top protein content, so I would like to invite you to join the exploration of Khorasan wheat.
